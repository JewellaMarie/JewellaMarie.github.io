    <h1> <br>ME-MIX: WHAT MAKES JEWELLA, A JEWEL-LA<br><br> </h1>
    <h2> WHAT ARE MY INTERESTS? </h2>
    <p><sup>1</sup> Okay, so I went on a quest to find my lost interests.
        <sup>2</sup> I thought they'd vanished into thin air, but then,... cue dramatic music, a song came on, and GIRL, if you just knew how my heart did a little flutter-kick.
        <sup>3</sup> Turns out, I do have interests after all, and apparently, they come with their own happy soundtrack.
        <sup>4</sup> Who knew?!
               <sup>5</sup> Well, obviously, one of them is indeed <strong>music</strong>.
        <sup>6</sup> I also enjoy the feeling of learning, and the feeling of reporting and teaching.
               <sup>7</sup> But not to be a teacher of a whole class tho, <strong>that's stressful!</strong>
        <sup>8</sup> I can see my professors having a hard time just by asking the class to settle down, this can't be me cause I love playful banters while teaching hihi.
        <sup>9</sup> I also love reading and watching but I seem to consider reading academic instruments as a stressful read.
        <sup>10</sup> But well, responsibility is a responsibility.
        <sup>11</sup> I also am keen of mathematic and sciences.
        <sup>12</sup> Nerdy stuff, right?
        <sup>13</sup> Well, I just enjoy studying medicines, universe, multiverses, and wait... I think I don't like math, I just like the feeling of accomplishment when doing something hard and that is one of those!
        <sup>14</sup> Well, as per my skills above, you can tell I love dance, books, and arts, right?
        <sup>15</sup> Speaking of books, I love science fiction to be exact.
        <sup>16</sup> Let's not elaborate on that and proceed to my next interest hihi.
        <sup>17</sup> Well, so sad to say, I'm really not a fan of outdoor activities but I can say that I love nature, can't I?
        <sup>18</sup> I just like riding instead of walking through it just to see one.
        <sup>19</sup> My lazy self wouldn't approve me of walking just to see sunsets.
        <sup>20</sup> I also like serving people in a way that I'd really be a big help in all their needs.
        <sup>21</sup> That's one reason why I joined the council during my freshmen year, but due to hectic schedules, I stayed with the council but as an executive staff only.
        <sup>22</sup> We're not rich to keep up with all the _ambagans_ and I am not free enough to keep up with all the responsibility of being an officer.
        <sup>23</sup> I want to serve with a quality work and I think as of now, this is not the time for me, yet.
        <sup>24</sup> So, there you have it â€“ a glimpse into the wonderfully chaotic landscape of my interests.
        <sup>25</sup> It's a mix of nerdy pursuits, creative passions, and a genuine desire to help others, all seasoned with a dash of laziness and a love for a good soundtrack.
        <sup>26</sup> It might seem like a jumbled mess, but it's my jumbled mess, and I'm slowly learning to embrace it.
        <sup>27</sup> Who knows where these rediscovered passions will lead, but I'm excited to find out.
