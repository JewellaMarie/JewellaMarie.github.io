            <blockquote><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                
                
                <sup>1</sup>"Childhood is a wonderful time of life, but it can also be a difficult time of life.
            You have to learn to deal with all sorts of things." <sup>2</sup>This quote from Fred Rogers
            resonated deeply with Jewella, whose childhood was far from idyllic. <sup>3</sup>As the eldest
            child in a household marred by her parents' tumultuous relationship, she witnessed
            firsthand the pain of infidelity. <sup>4</sup>The constant shouting and slamming doors created
            an unsettling environment, and the discovery of her father's infidelity at the age of
            six shattered her innocent view of the world. <sup>5</sup>Add the fact that her school life wasn't
            pleasant either, be bullied by people within her years. <sup>6</sup>She could also vividly
            remember her teacher throwing her meal away, and laughing for his own action,
            her classmate bullying her by throwing her books on the puddle and having to pick it
            up by herself. <sup>7</sup>This was such a sad era for her. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>This early trauma forced Jewella to
            mature beyond her years, grappling with emotions she shouldn't have had to
            confront at such a young age. <sup>9</sup>While her parents' relationship remained tumultuous
            and her school life unpleasant, Jewella found solace in the love of her grandparents. <sup>10</sup>
            She cherished the simple joys of playing bingo with her grandmother and engaging
            in playful banter with her grandfather. <sup>11</sup>She remembered pissing her
            lola off for
            always getting reward money whenever she wins and paying for her cards whenever
            she loses to her other playmates. <sup>12</sup>Those wonderful times. She also remembers
            herself asking for money, five to ten pesos most of the time to her
            lolo for food or
            junkies but he gave her a thousand peso. <sup>13</sup>She remembered regretting her decision
            of flaunting it to her grandmother because she confiscated the thousand peso bill
            and exchanged it for five pesos instead. <sup>14</sup>I know what you’re thinking right now.
            <sup>15</sup><em>“SAYANG!”</em> and yup! Looking back, it was really
            <em>sayang</em>. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>These moments of
            lightheartedness provided a much-needed escape from the turmoil at home. 
            <sup>17</sup>However, the sudden loss of her grandfather left a profound void in her life. <sup>18</sup>Though
            her mother offered words of comfort, the grief was undeniable. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>Unfortunately,
            Jewella's childhood was further complicated by a traumatic experience of sexual
            abuse at the hands of a family member, her cousin. <sup>20</sup>Thankfully, she was strong
            enough to fight back and nothing more than touch happened. <sup>21</sup>This deeply
            distressing event left lasting emotional scars. <sup>22</sup>Yet, despite the hardships she endured,
            Jewella developed a resilience that allowed her to navigate these challenges and
            emerge stronger. <sup>23</sup>This, an event she considered painful yet a wonderful lesson to
            never let anyone not worthy of your trust gain them. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>Pushing aside the pessimism,
            thinking about the happy moments in her life, especially the love from her
            grandparents. <sup>25</sup>She cherishes the memories of having all the toys she wanted, family
            car trips, and a childhood spent outdoors, unlike many kids today. <sup>26</sup>Her mom is the
            best. She created a loving world for her sister and her. <sup>27</sup>Despite limited resources,
            she made sure she had a wonderful childhood, filled with special experiences like
            extravagant meals, vacations, and parties. <sup>28</sup>She even managed to send us them to a
            private school with a private bus. 
            
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>She's an incredible mother, having to live by her
            belief that she’s gonna give the both of them a life she was unable to have during
            her time. <sup>30</sup>She might've been an unlucky wife, but she is a successful mother to them.
            <sup>31</sup><strong>BEST MOM EVER!</strong>

                <sup>1</sup>"Happy thirteenth, Jewella!" The air buzzed with joy as everyone celebrated
                Jewella's transition into her teenage years—her era, as some would say. <sup>2</sup>This
                marked the beginning of a period of immense growth and learning, though not
                always bathed in happiness. <sup>2</sup>Jewella blossomed, becoming stronger and wiser,
                navigating the complexities of adolescence. <sup>3</sup>A significant turning point came with a
                school transfer, sparking a surge in academic excellence and a transformation from
                introverted to vivacious. <sup>4</sup>She embraced leadership, consistently serving as class
                president, with flying colors during her high school graduation. <sup>5</sup>This, however, is just
                a glimpse of the full story. <sup>6</sup>A youthful romance led to heartbreak and betrayal. <sup>7</sup>Naive
                and trusting, she gave her all, only to be abused, used, and cheated on—
                experiences no young girl should endure. <sup>8</sup>While some might criticize her youthful
                indiscretions, it's undeniable that she was young and vulnerable, struggling to
                manage her emotions and capacity for love. 
                <br>
                <br>
                
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>But from these ashes of pain rose an
                incredibly resilient young woman. <sup>10</sup>She developed a sharp wit, unwavering bravery,
                and a carefree spirit. <sup>11</sup>Despite having strict parents, she found ways to enjoy life with
                her friends—a secret she kept from her father. <sup>12</sup>Her teenage years, after the initial
                heartbreak, were filled with joy and accomplishment. <sup>13</sup>She excelled in various
                competitions, winning beauty pageants, singing contests, dance competitions, and
                poetry slams, gaining recognition and building lasting friendships. <sup>14</sup>She nurtured self-
                love, self-care, and became more aware of the infidelities happening at home, even
                finding the courage to discuss it with her mother. <sup>15</sup>She would often offer comforting
                words, saying (in Tagalog, of course), "Mom, it's okay if you let go of what pains you
                most. <sup>16</sup>But I understand if your love for him is enough to still stay after everything. <sup>17</sup>
                I’m here." Yet, her teenage years weren't without their shadows. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>Haunted by the fear of being bullied, she sometimes resorted to being mean to others as a defense
                mechanism. <sup>19</sup>She erected walls around her heart, inadvertently causing pain to those
                sincere people around her. <sup>20</sup>Her pursuit of excellence, fueled by high expectations,
                led to overthinking and eventually a diagnosis of anxiety. <sup>22</sup>Education, once a
                sanctuary, became a battleground. <sup>23</sup>The pandemic, however, became a catalyst for
                further growth. <sup>24</sup>She became more emotionally detached, believing she could
                navigate life independently. <sup>25</sup>Balancing online classes with live streaming, she gained
                a substantial following and earned a significant income, reaching up to 50,000 pesos
                a month. <sup>26</sup>But the online world also brought its challenges. <sup>27</sup>Insecurities arose due to
                negative comments and, more surprisingly, criticism from fellow female streamers. <sup>28</sup>
                Despite her resilience to men's inappropriate comments, the unexpected negativity
                from women, particularly given her advocacy for women's empowerment, was a
                blow. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>Post-pandemic, Jewella continued to live with pride, cultivating strong and
                vibrant friendships, some faded with time, while others endured, strengthened by a
                commitment to stay connected and support each other, despite diverging paths. <sup>30</sup>
                They navigated the challenges of busy schedules, always finding time to be there for
                one another. <sup>31</sup>At this point in her life, she envisioned a future of independence, living
                alone with her beloved dogs and showering her nieces with affection—the
                quintessential "single rich
                <em>tita</em>", as some might say. <sup>32</sup>However, her path forward
                remained unclear. <sup>33</sup>Choosing the seemingly safest option, she embarked on the
                challenging STEM strand in senior high school, which she successfully completed
                with flying colors with high honors. <sup>34</sup>Through this academic journey, she discovered a
                passion for medicine and law, becoming torn between medtech, pharmaceutical
                sciences, and law. <sup>35</sup>Ultimately, she found a field that encompassed all her interests:
                <b>FORENSIC SCIENCE</b>! <sup>36</sup>Unfortunately, her mother, unwilling to let her go and
                concerned about the program's limited availability, discouraged her from pursuing it.
                <sup>37</sup>Her mother's consolation was that it wasn't a high-paying career, something Jewella
                desired. <sup>38</sup>And so, she found herself in college pursuing a degree in Information
                Technology. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>In a nutshell, Jewella's teenage years were a rollercoaster of
                experiences, from the innocent joy of early adolescence to the pain of betrayal and
                the challenges of navigating social pressures and academic expectations. <sup>40</sup>She
                experienced both immense heartbreak and incredible resilience, ultimately growing
                into a strong and independent young woman. <sup>41</sup>The pandemic further solidified her
                self-reliance, though it also exposed the darker side of online fame. <sup>42</sup>It was a roller
                coaster ride, but for the first time, she really enjoyed. <sup>43</sup><b>SHE'S FINALLY GETTING

            <blockquote> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                
                <sup>1</sup><em>"HIRAP!"</em> This became one of Jewella's signature phrases in college. <sup>2</sup>Life,
                however, was smoother this time around. <sup>3</sup>She was enjoying herself, actively
                participating in various events, serving as a first-year representative, and
                maintaining her status as a consistent university scholar. <sup>4</sup>College life, though, had its
                stagnant moments. <sup>5</sup>Initially grateful for her half-day schedule, she soon discovered it
                wasn't the norm. <sup>6</sup>But those times were indeed golden. <sup>7</sup>She excelled academically
                while enjoying her free time, playing billiards and socializing without financial worries,
                thanks to her past frugality. <sup>8</sup>Yet, unwanted attention persisted. <sup>9</sup>She still faced
                harassment from perverts, including an incident with a fellow organization member
                who forcibly touched her. <sup>10</sup>Men from other colleges also made her uncomfortable
                with their unwanted advances. <sup>11</sup>However, these experiences, while not new, were
                met with a newfound bravery. <sup>12</sup>She navigated these situations gracefully and without
                force. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>In November 2023, she met someone who finally piqued her interest, after a
                string of uninspiring encounters. <sup>14</sup>He was a guy she met on the university's freedom
                wall, only to discover he attended the Caloocan campus, not Manila. <sup>15</sup>Their initial
                interactions weren't really happy and fond, she hated him actually. <sup>16</sup>But they grew
                closer with time, discovering mutual feelings. <sup>17</sup>She was a freshman, and he was a
                senior, a semester behind in mechanical engineering, which allowed them to still
                cross paths on campus. <sup>18</sup>Their relationship was a roller coaster of highs and lows,
                marked by traumas, but ultimately, she found peace and chose forgiveness. <sup>19</sup>She had
                seen and experienced enough to understand. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>From this point on, college became
                less exciting. <sup>21</sup>Hectic schedules transformed her into a home-school girl, rarely
                socializing, spending her time in libraries or sleeping at home, interacting mainly
                with her partner and occasionally some friends. <sup>22</sup>She maintained her high standards,
                driven by a fear of disappointing others, pushing herself to study even harder,
                sometimes to her detriment. <sup>23</sup>She longed for a life free from the pressure to excel,
                yet she also didn't want to disappoint her parents, who were so happy with her
                achievements. <sup>24</sup>Her mother, despite the ongoing infidelity, continued to forgive, a
                situation Jewella had long since detached herself from. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>Life settled into a routine,
                secure and steady. <sup>26</sup>She persevered through her college years, aiming for success.
                <sup>27</sup>She also tutored her classmates sometimes for free lunch (<em>kuripot padin huhu</em>). <sup>28</sup>But
                what really fulfills her is their act of being thankful for she had played a great role in
                their success to pass the college still until as of the moment. <sup>29</sup>Whether or not she
                graduated with Latin honors in which it’s part of her plan, she knew she was trying
                her best in a course she didn't truly enjoy but chose for its perceived financial
                security. <sup>30</sup>Pushing through a major she wasn't passionate about was difficult, but the
                desire for a comfortable future and desire to give her parents the best life, especially
                given that her mom crawled to let us finish in a private university, fueled her efforts.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>Jewella's college years were marked by academic success, new friendships, and a
                developing romantic relationship. <sup>32</sup>She faced continued harassment but met it with
                resilience. <sup>33</sup>While college life became less stimulating, she remained focused on her
                studies, driven by a desire for financial stability, despite not enjoying her chosen
                field.
