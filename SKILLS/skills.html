            <sup>1</sup>It's kinda funny how my skills are a bit off-brand for my program.  <sup>2</sup>But instead of thinking about that, let's talk about what I <strong>CAN</strong> do, shall we? <sup>3</sup>While my skills might not be a lot, I've got a secret weapon I am sure of, my singing voice! <sup>4</sup>I've actually won some competitions and even made some moooney doing it. <sup>5</sup>Which is a major point of pride. <sup>6</sup>I'm also a dancer, I know, <em> hindi halata </em> but think cheerleading, modern dance? Those are my things! <sup>7</sup>Sometimes I nailed it, sometimes I face-planted. <sup>8</sup>But even epic fails are just fuel for passion, right? <sup>9</sup>Now, I'm not exactly what you'd call "athletic" but I'm surprisingly decent at badminton! <sup>10</sup>Sadly, my current living situation isn't exactly badminton-court type of spacious, so that skill's a little unused and ingrown, LOL. <sup>11</sup>Okay, enough about my unworthy sporting greatness. Let's talk academics! <sup>12</sup>I'm a bit of a poet and a songwriter.  <sup>13</sup>The lady has been a little shy lately, but give her an inspiration, and I can share up some verses in no time. <sup>14</sup>Especially if it's for a grade. <sup>15</sup>I'm also good with adapting! <sup>16</sup>I can learn pretty much anything, even if I start knowing absolutely nothing such as this program, IT. <sup>17</sup>One of my points in saying this is my knowledge in <em>*drum roll please!*</em> HTML! <sup>18</sup> Growing up, computers weren't exactly my school's thing. <sup>19</sup>But thanks to my ability to adapt, I caught up with the coding-smart people within my circle. <sup>20</sup>I love the brain-bleeding <em>(joke lang po hehe) </em>challenge of coding, and then I unwind by writing, where I get to share my unbreak-able skills in the world (or at least, to whoever's reading). <sup>21</sup>Another superpower? I can take complicated stuff and make it easy to understand.  <sup>22</sup>And I love sharing that knowledge!  The best feeling is when someone says, <sup>23</sup><q>Thank you, Jewe. Natuto kami lalo dahil sa'yo. </q></em> Well anyways, I think that's it for now! <sup>24</sup>Let's proceed before you get bored of my yapping.  <br><br><br>

            <sup>1</sup> Okay, so I went on a quest to find my lost interests.
            <sup>2</sup> I thought they'd vanished into thin air, but then,... cue dramatic music, a song came on, and GIRL, if you just knew how my heart did a little flutter-kick.
            <sup>3</sup> Turns out, I do have interests after all, and apparently, they come with their own happy soundtrack.
            <sup>4</sup> Who knew?!
            <sup>5</sup> Well, obviously, one of them is indeed <strong>music</strong>.
            <sup>6</sup> I also enjoy the feeling of learning, and the feeling of reporting and teaching.
            <sup>7</sup> But not to be a teacher of a whole class tho, <strong>that's stressful!</strong>
            <sup>8</sup> I can see my professors having a hard time just by asking the class to settle down, this can't be me cause I love playful banters while teaching hihi.
            <sup>9</sup> I also love reading and watching but I seem to consider reading academic instruments as a stressful read.
            <sup>10</sup> But well, responsibility is a responsibility.
            <sup>11</sup> I also am keen of mathematic and sciences.
            <sup>12</sup> Nerdy stuff, right?
            <sup>13</sup> Well, I just enjoy studying medicines, universe, multiverses, and wait... I think I don't like math, I just like the feeling of accomplishment when doing something hard and that is one of those!
            <sup>14</sup> Well, as per my skills above, you can tell I love dance, books, and arts, right?
            <sup>15</sup> Speaking of books, I love science fiction to be exact.
            <sup>16</sup> Let's not elaborate on that and proceed to my next interest hihi.
            <sup>17</sup> Well, so sad to say, I'm really not a fan of outdoor activities but I can say that I love nature, can't I?
            <sup>18</sup> I just like riding instead of walking through it just to see one.
            <sup>19</sup> My lazy self wouldn't approve me of walking just to see sunsets.
            <sup>20</sup> I also like serving people in a way that I'd really be a big help in all their needs.
            <sup>21</sup> That's one reason why I joined the council during my freshmen year, but due to hectic schedules, I stayed with the council but as an executive staff only.
            <sup>22</sup> We're not rich to keep up with all the _ambagans_ and I am not free enough to keep up with all the responsibility of being an officer.
            <sup>23</sup> I want to serve with a quality work and I think as of now, this is not the time for me, yet.
            <sup>24</sup> So, there you have it – a glimpse into the wonderfully chaotic landscape of my interests.
            <sup>25</sup> It's a mix of nerdy pursuits, creative passions, and a genuine desire to help others, all seasoned with a dash of laziness and a love for a good soundtrack.
            <sup>26</sup> It might seem like a jumbled mess, but it's my jumbled mess, and I'm slowly learning to embrace it.
            <sup>27</sup> Who knows where these rediscovered passions will lead, but I'm excited to find out.

            <sup>1</sup> My hobby journey has been a process of self-discovery.
            <sup>2</sup> For a long time, I didn't think I had many hobbies.
            <sup>3</sup> My father always emphasized my roles as a daughter and student, which shaped my perception of myself.
            <sup>4</sup> However, I eventually realized I was more than that.
            <sup>5</sup> I'm a friend, a sister, a partner, and even a teacher to some.
            <sup>6</sup> This realization sparked a desire to explore new hobbies.
            <sup>7</sup> Firstly, streaming became a regular activity for me.
            <sup>8</sup> It allowed me to socialize and earn money simultaneously.
            <sup>9</sup> It transformed into a profitable and enjoyable hobby.
            <sup>10</sup> I've also become known as a bit of a "Local news source," though I'm still getting to know the newest students.
            <sup>11</sup> My schedule has been so hectic lately!
            <sup>12</sup> Moreover, community projects are something I enjoy when I have time.
            <sup>13</sup> Another is that teaching is a true passion, and I consider it a hobby I cherish.
            <sup>14</sup> Blogging is another secret hobby of mine.
            <sup>15</sup> I keep a file of local news and updates (gossips), all neatly organized with bullet points.
            <sup>16</sup> It's become a regular habit, also crochet!
            <sup>17</sup> I know I have been saying this a lot of times now, but one thing I consider a hobby too is my <strong>S-I-N-G-I-N-G!</strong>
            <sup>18</sup> that is for sure something no one could ever take away from me, my love for music.
            <sup>19</sup> I even used it as a study method in high school converting study materials to songs so I could remember.
            <sup>20</sup> It's an interest, a skill, and a beloved hobby all rolled into one.
            <sup>21</sup> I also have a natural curiosity and love exploring new things.
            <sup>22</sup> I'm always eager to learn, even beyond what I'm formally taught.
            <sup>23</sup> For example, I've been exploring border characteristics and experimenting with photos on my website.
            <sup>24</sup> It's a little preview of what's to come!
            <sup>25</sup> Watching movies and short skits is my way to unwind after long study sessions such as tiktoks.
            <sup>26</sup> They're my escape and my haven.
            <sup>27</sup> My hobbies might seem quiet and not overly adventurous.
            <sup>28</sup> However, I have a good reason for that.
            <sup>29</sup> My grades and scholarship are my top priorities to even think about adding more.
            <sup>30</sup> I believe that adding too many extra activities right now would only lead to more stress, and I need to maintain balance.
            <sup>31</sup> All in all, I am content with what I do and I am hoping that in the future after all the pressures have been lifted off my chest, I'd get the chance to do more.
