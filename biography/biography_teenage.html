            <div align ="justify"> <blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>"Happy thirteenth, Jewella!" The air buzzed with joy as everyone celebrated
                Jewella's transition into her teenage years—her era, as some would say. <sup>2</sup>This
                marked the beginning of a period of immense growth and learning, though not
                always bathed in happiness. <sup>2</sup>Jewella blossomed, becoming stronger and wiser,
                navigating the complexities of adolescence. <sup>3</sup>A significant turning point came with a
                school transfer, sparking a surge in academic excellence and a transformation from
                introverted to vivacious. <sup>4</sup>She embraced leadership, consistently serving as class
                president, with flying colors during her high school graduation. <sup>5</sup>This, however, is just
                a glimpse of the full story. <sup>6</sup>A youthful romance led to heartbreak and betrayal. <sup>7</sup>Naive
                and trusting, she gave her all, only to be abused, used, and cheated on—
                experiences no young girl should endure. <sup>8</sup>While some might criticize her youthful
                indiscretions, it's undeniable that she was young and vulnerable, struggling to
                manage her emotions and capacity for love. 
                <br>
                <br>
                
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>But from these ashes of pain rose an
                incredibly resilient young woman. <sup>10</sup>She developed a sharp wit, unwavering bravery,
                and a carefree spirit. <sup>11</sup>Despite having strict parents, she found ways to enjoy life with
                her friends—a secret she kept from her father. <sup>12</sup>Her teenage years, after the initial
                heartbreak, were filled with joy and accomplishment. <sup>13</sup>She excelled in various
                competitions, winning beauty pageants, singing contests, dance competitions, and
                poetry slams, gaining recognition and building lasting friendships. <sup>14</sup>She nurtured self-
                love, self-care, and became more aware of the infidelities happening at home, even
                finding the courage to discuss it with her mother. <sup>15</sup>She would often offer comforting
                words, saying (in Tagalog, of course), "Mom, it's okay if you let go of what pains you
                most. <sup>16</sup>But I understand if your love for him is enough to still stay after everything. <sup>17</sup>
                I’m here." Yet, her teenage years weren't without their shadows. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>Haunted by the fear of being bullied, she sometimes resorted to being mean to others as a defense
                mechanism. <sup>19</sup>She erected walls around her heart, inadvertently causing pain to those
                sincere people around her. <sup>20</sup>Her pursuit of excellence, fueled by high expectations,
                led to overthinking and eventually a diagnosis of anxiety. <sup>22</sup>Education, once a
                sanctuary, became a battleground. <sup>23</sup>The pandemic, however, became a catalyst for
                further growth. <sup>24</sup>She became more emotionally detached, believing she could
                navigate life independently. <sup>25</sup>Balancing online classes with live streaming, she gained
                a substantial following and earned a significant income, reaching up to 50,000 pesos
                a month. <sup>26</sup>But the online world also brought its challenges. <sup>27</sup>Insecurities arose due to
                negative comments and, more surprisingly, criticism from fellow female streamers. <sup>28</sup>
                Despite her resilience to men's inappropriate comments, the unexpected negativity
                from women, particularly given her advocacy for women's empowerment, was a
                blow. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>Post-pandemic, Jewella continued to live with pride, cultivating strong and
                vibrant friendships, some faded with time, while others endured, strengthened by a
                commitment to stay connected and support each other, despite diverging paths. <sup>30</sup>
                They navigated the challenges of busy schedules, always finding time to be there for
                one another. <sup>31</sup>At this point in her life, she envisioned a future of independence, living
                alone with her beloved dogs and showering her nieces with affection—the
                quintessential "single rich
                <em>tita</em>", as some might say. <sup>32</sup>However, her path forward
                remained unclear. <sup>33</sup>Choosing the seemingly safest option, she embarked on the
                challenging STEM strand in senior high school, which she successfully completed
                with flying colors with high honors. <sup>34</sup>Through this academic journey, she discovered a
                passion for medicine and law, becoming torn between medtech, pharmaceutical
                sciences, and law. <sup>35</sup>Ultimately, she found a field that encompassed all her interests:
                <b>FORENSIC SCIENCE</b>! <sup>36</sup>Unfortunately, her mother, unwilling to let her go and
                concerned about the program's limited availability, discouraged her from pursuing it.
                <sup>37</sup>Her mother's consolation was that it wasn't a high-paying career, something Jewella
                desired. <sup>38</sup>And so, she found herself in college pursuing a degree in Information
                Technology. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>In a nutshell, Jewella's teenage years were a rollercoaster of
                experiences, from the innocent joy of early adolescence to the pain of betrayal and
                the challenges of navigating social pressures and academic expectations. <sup>40</sup>She
                experienced both immense heartbreak and incredible resilience, ultimately growing
                into a strong and independent young woman. <sup>41</sup>The pandemic further solidified her
                self-reliance, though it also exposed the darker side of online fame. <sup>42</sup>It was a roller
                coaster ride, but for the first time, she really enjoyed. <sup>43</sup><b>SHE'S FINALLY GETTING
