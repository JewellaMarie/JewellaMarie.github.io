            <div align ="justify"> <blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup><em>"HIRAP!"</em> This became one of Jewella's signature phrases in college. <sup>2</sup>Life,
                however, was smoother this time around. <sup>3</sup>She was enjoying herself, actively
                participating in various events, serving as a first-year representative, and
                maintaining her status as a consistent university scholar. <sup>4</sup>College life, though, had its
                stagnant moments. <sup>5</sup>Initially grateful for her half-day schedule, she soon discovered it
                wasn't the norm. <sup>6</sup>But those times were indeed golden. <sup>7</sup>She excelled academically
                while enjoying her free time, playing billiards and socializing without financial worries,
                thanks to her past frugality. <sup>8</sup>Yet, unwanted attention persisted. <sup>9</sup>She still faced
                harassment from perverts, including an incident with a fellow organization member
                who forcibly touched her. <sup>10</sup>Men from other colleges also made her uncomfortable
                with their unwanted advances. <sup>11</sup>However, these experiences, while not new, were
                met with a newfound bravery. <sup>12</sup>She navigated these situations gracefully and without
                force. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>In November 2023, she met someone who finally piqued her interest, after a
                string of uninspiring encounters. <sup>14</sup>He was a guy she met on the university's freedom
                wall, only to discover he attended the Caloocan campus, not Manila. <sup>15</sup>Their initial
                interactions weren't really happy and fond, she hated him actually. <sup>16</sup>But they grew
                closer with time, discovering mutual feelings. <sup>17</sup>She was a freshman, and he was a
                senior, a semester behind in mechanical engineering, which allowed them to still
                cross paths on campus. <sup>18</sup>Their relationship was a roller coaster of highs and lows,
                marked by traumas, but ultimately, she found peace and chose forgiveness. <sup>19</sup>She had
                seen and experienced enough to understand. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>From this point on, college became
                less exciting. <sup>21</sup>Hectic schedules transformed her into a home-school girl, rarely
                socializing, spending her time in libraries or sleeping at home, interacting mainly
                with her partner and occasionally some friends. <sup>22</sup>She maintained her high standards,
                driven by a fear of disappointing others, pushing herself to study even harder,
                sometimes to her detriment. <sup>23</sup>She longed for a life free from the pressure to excel,
                yet she also didn't want to disappoint her parents, who were so happy with her
                achievements. <sup>24</sup>Her mother, despite the ongoing infidelity, continued to forgive, a
                situation Jewella had long since detached herself from. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>Life settled into a routine,
                secure and steady. <sup>26</sup>She persevered through her college years, aiming for success.
                <sup>27</sup>She also tutored her classmates sometimes for free lunch (<em>kuripot padin huhu</em>). <sup>28</sup>But
                what really fulfills her is their act of being thankful for she had played a great role in
                their success to pass the college still until as of the moment. <sup>29</sup>Whether or not she
                graduated with Latin honors in which it’s part of her plan, she knew she was trying
                her best in a course she didn't truly enjoy but chose for its perceived financial
                security. <sup>30</sup>Pushing through a major she wasn't passionate about was difficult, but the
                desire for a comfortable future and desire to give her parents the best life, especially
                given that her mom crawled to let us finish in a private university, fueled her efforts.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>Jewella's college years were marked by academic success, new friendships, and a
                developing romantic relationship. <sup>32</sup>She faced continued harassment but met it with
                resilience. <sup>33</sup>While college life became less stimulating, she remained focused on her
                studies, driven by a desire for financial stability, despite not enjoying her chosen
                field.
