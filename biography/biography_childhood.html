            <div align ="justify"> <blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>"Childhood is a wonderful time of life, but it can also be a difficult time of life.
            You have to learn to deal with all sorts of things." <sup>2</sup>This quote from Fred Rogers
            resonated deeply with Jewella, whose childhood was far from idyllic. <sup>3</sup>As the eldest
            child in a household marred by her parents' tumultuous relationship, she witnessed
            firsthand the pain of infidelity. <sup>4</sup>The constant shouting and slamming doors created
            an unsettling environment, and the discovery of her father's infidelity at the age of
            six shattered her innocent view of the world. <sup>5</sup>Add the fact that her school life wasn't
            pleasant either, be bullied by people within her years. <sup>6</sup>She could also vividly
            remember her teacher throwing her meal away, and laughing for his own action,
            her classmate bullying her by throwing her books on the puddle and having to pick it
            up by herself. <sup>7</sup>This was such a sad era for her. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>This early trauma forced Jewella to
            mature beyond her years, grappling with emotions she shouldn't have had to
            confront at such a young age. <sup>9</sup>While her parents' relationship remained tumultuous
            and her school life unpleasant, Jewella found solace in the love of her grandparents. <sup>10</sup>
            She cherished the simple joys of playing bingo with her grandmother and engaging
            in playful banter with her grandfather. <sup>11</sup>She remembered pissing her
            lola off for
            always getting reward money whenever she wins and paying for her cards whenever
            she loses to her other playmates. <sup>12</sup>Those wonderful times. She also remembers
            herself asking for money, five to ten pesos most of the time to her
            lolo for food or
            junkies but he gave her a thousand peso. <sup>13</sup>She remembered regretting her decision
            of flaunting it to her grandmother because she confiscated the thousand peso bill
            and exchanged it for five pesos instead. <sup>14</sup>I know what you’re thinking right now.
            <sup>15</sup><em>“SAYANG!”</em> and yup! Looking back, it was really
            <em>sayang</em>. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>These moments of
            lightheartedness provided a much-needed escape from the turmoil at home. 
            <sup>17</sup>However, the sudden loss of her grandfather left a profound void in her life. <sup>18</sup>Though
            her mother offered words of comfort, the grief was undeniable. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>Unfortunately,
            Jewella's childhood was further complicated by a traumatic experience of sexual
            abuse at the hands of a family member, her cousin. <sup>20</sup>Thankfully, she was strong
            enough to fight back and nothing more than touch happened. <sup>21</sup>This deeply
            distressing event left lasting emotional scars. <sup>22</sup>Yet, despite the hardships she endured,
            Jewella developed a resilience that allowed her to navigate these challenges and
            emerge stronger. <sup>23</sup>This, an event she considered painful yet a wonderful lesson to
            never let anyone not worthy of your trust gain them. 
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>Pushing aside the pessimism,
            thinking about the happy moments in her life, especially the love from her
            grandparents. <sup>25</sup>She cherishes the memories of having all the toys she wanted, family
            car trips, and a childhood spent outdoors, unlike many kids today. <sup>26</sup>Her mom is the
            best. She created a loving world for her sister and her. <sup>27</sup>Despite limited resources,
            she made sure she had a wonderful childhood, filled with special experiences like
            extravagant meals, vacations, and parties. <sup>28</sup>She even managed to send us them to a
            private school with a private bus. 
            
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>She's an incredible mother, having to live by her
            belief that she’s gonna give the both of them a life she was unable to have during
            her time. <sup>30</sup>She might've been an unlucky wife, but she is a successful mother to them.
            <sup>31</sup><strong>BEST MOM EVER!</strong>
